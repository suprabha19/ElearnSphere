I am making an elearning platform named elearnsphere in which students can enroll and instructor add teaching materials and guide learning process and admin manages overall platform so, there are three roles ; student, admin and instructor. I want a fully functioned website with frontend, backend, databases integration and algorithm and task management .
Languages planning to use : 
Front end : react.js
 Backend : node.js, express 
databases: Mongodb Atlas(NoSQL)
security and authentication: JWT, 2FA(EmailOTP and Google authenticator) and backup codes
frontend styling : Tailwind css
Routing : React Router
Algorithm: DFS recommendation algorithm for student dashboard to recommend courses  and QuizPath: Adaptive Pathway Quiz Algorithm
QuizPath dynamically guides each learner through a personalized quiz journey by adapting question flow based on their answers. Like a wise mentor, it branches through a tree of questions, unlocking the right challenges at the right time to sharpen skills without overwhelming. It blends traditional traversal techniques with adaptive logic to create a smooth, engaging, and effective assessment experience ‚Äî respecting the learner‚Äôs pace while pushing them forward.
I have created some frontend content for my project which includes a homepage section with a navbar with a name of the project ElearnSphere, a search bar to search and explore. Now, section includes different pages in which knowledgebase includes AI knowledgebase for real-time support which should be supported by chatbot, and a knowledgebase grid with different contents inside it. Manage that content. Course page includes all courses and single course section, all courses section should display courses added by instructor or admin, which should include image, title, short description, category, price, and lessons number. And single course should give description of any clicked course from all courses section and then we have product section which should include products which support the learning process similar as all course section and another one is blog section which includes blog added by instructors or admin and about us page, this all is included in explore section of navbar when we open the website.
Then comes the login and signup section, as we are planning to have three roles, student, instructor and admin, instructor and admin should go through the verification and authentication, new instructors or new admin should be verified by admin, also add email OTP and Google Authenticator (2FA) for extra security for Admin and Instructor login, also add force TOTP setup for Admin/Instructor on first login and backup codes in case Admin or Instructor loses access to their Google Authenticator and regenerate backup codes feature in admin dashboard.
After login in each role, student/instructor/admin should be directed to their own dashboard.
Student Dashboard ‚Äî The Learner‚Äôs Sanctuary üìö
This is where students feel the learning journey, get motivated, and keep everything organized.
Must-haves:
My Courses:
List of enrolled courses with progress bars, completion percentages, next lessons, deadlines.
Continue Learning:
Quick links/buttons to resume last viewed lessons or quizzes.

Quiz Scores & Feedback:
Past quiz results, feedback from instructors, suggestions for improvement.
Course Recommendations:
Smart suggestions based on completed courses and interests (powered by algorithms like QuizPath).
Announcements & Messages:
Updates from instructors or platform admins (new courses, maintenance, tips).
Profile & Settings:
Basic personal info, password reset, 2FA settings.
Instructor Dashboard ‚Äî The Mentor‚Äôs Command Center üéì
This is the hub for creators and guides to manage their classes, track student progress, and create content.
Must-haves:
My Courses:
Courses created, with options to add/edit lessons, quizzes, assignments.
Student Progress Overview:
Analytics dashboard showing enrollment numbers, average grades, quiz pass rates, engagement stats.
Manage Quizzes & Assignments:

Create New Course:

Resource Upload:
Upload documents, videos, or external links to enrich content.
Profile & Settings:

Admin Dashboard ‚Äî The Overlord‚Äôs Control Room üëë
Admins are the kings and queens of the platform. They keep everything running smoothly and maintain order.
Must-haves:
User Management:
View, approve, block, or delete students, instructors, and other admins.
Role & Permission Controls:
Assign roles, manage access levels, approve instructor course creations.
Platform Analytics:
High-level stats: total users, active courses, revenue (if any), site traffic, engagement metrics.
Course Management:

Backup Codes & Security:
Manage emergency access, regenerate backup codes for admins/instructors.
Site Settings:
Platform-wide settings like branding, email templates, notification preferences.

A Few Bonus Thoughts:
Unified Notifications: Push notifications or alerts tailored for each role.
Responsive Design: All dashboards must work beautifully on mobile and desktop.
Role-Based Navigation: Only show menus and features relevant to the user role to avoid clutter.

This setup respects the classic structure of role-based dashboards but makes room for modern user experience and smart tech integration.
Want me to sketch a wireframe or suggest React component breakdowns for these dashboards next?

You said:
now include all theses i one
ChatGPT said:
Got it, Suprabha ‚Äî let's forge the ultimate unified dashboard blueprint for Students, Instructors, and Admins with Cart, Notifications, Payments, and even your QuizPath algorithm all in one clear structure.
This will be the one dashboard guide to rule them all. üè∞

also after login there should be a user profile visible on top right with user profile information when clicked and logout options for each roles
